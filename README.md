# README Generator

## Project Description

This Node.js tool automates the process of generating a README.md file for a project. It prompts the user for information about the project, using the inquirer module to ask a series of questions and the fs module to write the user's answers to a file.

In this tool, the inquirer module is used to ask the user for information about their project, including the project title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions.

In this tool, the fs module is used to write the user's answers to a pre-defined template for a README.md file. The resulting README.md file contains important information about the project, such as its title, description, and usage instructions.

By using inquirer and fs together, this tool automates the process of creating a README.md file for a project. It ensures that important information about the project is included in the file, and saves the user time and effort by eliminating the need to manually create and format the file.
